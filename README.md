MediaWiki-extension-OnlyRecentRecentChanges
===========================================

The behaviour of the recent changes view is changed so that any changed article is only listed once, older changes are not listed any longer. The current version also suppresses log events (delete, upload ...) because I don't know how to avoid this unwanted side effect.
